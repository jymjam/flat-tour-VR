## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
User interactive, Virtual reality house tour, that was made purely on aframe.
The model is to the scale created, considering a person's height to be 1.6m.

## Features
* 3D Virtual Reality
* functional light switches in rooms.
* working Television.
* supports both mouse clicks to register events and ray-casting for VR headsets (look for a red dot).

#### EVERYTHING IN THIS PROJECT IS HOMEMADE, 
* the house model, including the furnitures were made on **blender**
* __except__ Skybox panoramic image: [source website](texturify.com)

## Known Bugs
* My 3D models are dimensions are inverted. causing a mental diarrhoea.
* few walls have gaps. probably due to miscalculations on blender.
